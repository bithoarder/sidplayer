<p>
The SID Player application only comes with a small selection of all the SID tunes avilable in the High Voltage SID Collection.
</p>

<p>
To get access to all 37000+ tunes, you must download the Complete HSVC zip file and install it on your android device.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.hvsc.de/#download">hvsc.de</a> and download the "Complete HVSC" zip file. You can download it from any of the mirrors, 
but make sure you download the zip file, and not the rar archive.</li>
<li>When the downloading is done, you should have a archive called something like "HVSC_52-all-of-them.zip". Extract this zip file; 
inside it will be another zip file called C64Music.zip.</li>
<li>Copy the C64Music.zip archive to the phones memory card. You can safely overwrite the small demo C64Music.zip that was installed on the 
memory card when you first ran SID Player.</li>
